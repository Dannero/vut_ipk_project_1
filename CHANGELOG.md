# IPK 2023 Project 1

## How to build and run
```
$ make
$ ./ipkcpc -h <host> -p <port> -m <mode>
```

`$ make clean` to remove build files

**host** - IPv4 address of the server the program connects to \
**port** - server port \
**mode** - connection mode (only "tcp"/"udp") 

The order of the arguments is interchangeable

## Implementation details
The ipkcpc script has been written in the C language. After launching it, the input arguments are checked for their validity. Based on the mode that was chosen by the user, the program connects to the desired server in said mode. The program enters a while cycle processing user's input, sending the input to the server and receiving and printing the output from the server. 
In TCP mode, the input is sent directly to the server, while in UDP mode the input is reformatted to the IPK Calculator protocol specification (a null byte at the front of the string, followed by a byte containing the length of the string and then the string itself). After receiving the server's answer in UDP mode, the opcode and status code are checked and OK/ERR messaged are displayed.

The program uses `signal`, `sig_handler_tcp` and `sig_handler_udp` functions to tackle SIGINT raising and exit the program gracefully. \
`sig_handler_tcp` sends a "BYE" message to the server after being called by the `signal` function, waits for the server to answer with "BYE" and closes connection. \
`sig_handler_udp` closes connection after being called by the `signal` function.

UDP communication has an answer timeout set at 10 seconds using the `sys/time.h` header file and the `setsockopt` function.

## Issues
1. Program is only compatible with UNIX systems, I have included necessary Windows specific header files, but I was not able to make the program run on this system
2. Although it was not recommended in the project discussion forum, I have made the `client_socket` variable into a global one to make connection closing possible in functions handling a SIGINT raise
